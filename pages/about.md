Hi, I am **Hossein** :wave:

<br>

I am a PhD Candidate and concurrently pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Computer Science at Virginia Tech, with a strong passion for Robotics and AI. My research focuses on advancing robot autonomy in unstructured environments, particularly on construction jobsites, by leveraging AI-driven solutions.

My ultimate goal is to bridge the gap between human-level reasoning, dexterity, and adaptability in robotics, empowering robots to take on hazardous tasks in real-world construction settings. To achieve this, I explore foundation models, with a particular emphasis on Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Multi-AI Agent Systems.

Throughout my research and development journey, I improved my skills in:
- ðŸ–¥ Programming: C++, Python, Java  
- ðŸ¤– Robotics Frameworks: ROS2/ROS, Gazebo, MoveIt  
- ðŸ§  AI & Machine Learning: TensorFlow, OpenCV, PyTorch, Transformers  
- ðŸ“¡ Foundation Models: Vision-Language Models, Large Language Models, CrewAI, AutoGen  
- ðŸ›  Development Tools: Linux, Git  

<br>

I am always open to discussions, brainstorming sessions, and collaboration opportunities! If you share my enthusiasm for robotics, AI, or automation, letâ€™s connect.

When Iâ€™m not working with robots, youâ€™ll probably find me:
- ðŸŽ¨ Painting
- ðŸŽ¬ Watching movies
- ðŸŽ’ Going on backpacking trips 

Let's push the boundaries of robotics together! ðŸ¤–âœ¨
