# About Me


<br>

Hi, I am **Hossein** :wave:

<br>

I am a PhD Candidate and at the same time a CS master student at $${\color[HTML]{861F41}Virginia \space Tech}$$ and a passionate researcher in **Robotics and AI**. My research focuses on enhancing robot autonomy in unstructured environments, especially construction jobsites, through AI-driven solutions. 

My ultimate goal? Bridging the gap between human-level thinking, dexterity, and adaptability in robotics, enabling robots to take on dangerous tasks in real-world construction environments. To achieve this, I explore foundation models, particularly: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Multi-AI Agent Systems.

Throughout my research and development journey, I have honed my skills in:
- ðŸ–¥ Programming: C++, Python, Java  
- ðŸ¤– Robotics Frameworks: ROS2/ROS, Gazebo, MoveIt  
- ðŸ§  AI & Machine Learning: TensorFlow, OpenCV, PyTorch, Transformers  
- ðŸ“¡ Foundation Models: Vision-Language Models, Large Language Models, CrewAI, AutoGen  
- ðŸ›  Development Tools: Linux, Git  

<br>

I am always open to discussions, brainstorming sessions, and collaboration opportunities! If you share my enthusiasm for robotics, AI, or automation, letâ€™s connect.

When Iâ€™m not working with robots, youâ€™ll probably find me:
- ðŸŽ¨ Painting
- ðŸŽ¬ Watching movies
- ðŸŽ’ Going on backpacking trips 

Let's push the boundaries of robotics together! ðŸ¤–âœ¨
